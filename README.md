# Gobang (Five-In-A-Row) Deep Learning AI based on Residual Neural Network  

[TOC]  

## Summary  

A Gobang AI, a software running on Windows, Linux and Mac OS devices. The software mainly provides functions of Player VS Computer. It supports steps record and undoing steps.  
Main core is a deep learning AI based on famous Residual Network. It begins from tabula rasa, first move randomly, and then strengthen its intelligence through losses and wins. It can learn players' style and finally surpass players.  

## Keywords  

Gobang, Five-In-A-Row, FIAR, FIR, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, AI, Neural Network, Residual Network, ResNet.  

## 1 Introduction  

### 1.1 Status quo  

There haven't been any company or organization working on the Gobang deep learning AI.  
A few such projects on github, but none is completed.  

### 1.2 Software  

This project mainly uses Python 3 language. Also uses Tkinter module to build GUI (Graphical User Interface).  

### 1.3 Inovation  

Applying deep learning AI to the game of Gobang is novel in the world.  

## 2 Training Details  

### 2.1 Overview  

Using a victor (s) to record board state, 1 for white, -1 for black, and 0 for empty. Another victor (a) is used to record the next possible steps, i.e. those which is 0 in s.  

### 2.2 Network Structure  

TODO (December 6)  

### 2.3 Strengthen learning  

TODO (December 13)  

### 2.4 Summary  

TODO (December 13)  

## 3 Outlook  

It may take a long time and a great number of games to train the AI. The next step is to improve efficiency of training.
